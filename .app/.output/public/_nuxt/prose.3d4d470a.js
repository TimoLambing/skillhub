  <h1>Garlic bread with cheese: What the science tells us</h1>
  <p>
  For years parents have espoused the health benefits of eating garlic bread with cheese to their
  children, with the food earning such an iconic status in our culture that kids will often dress
  up as warm, cheesy loaf for Halloween.

  <p>
  But a recent study shows that the celebrated appetizer may be linked to a series of rabies cases
  springing up around the country.
