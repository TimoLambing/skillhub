      A bit about the background of this project: I have worked in the production sector, both in construction and electrical installations, and later started brokering rental labor. I discovered that larger companies consistently need reliable labor on short notice as they constantly have fires to put out. At such times, they are willing to pay well. However, the need is often short-term, and sometimes finding the extra hand is a matter of hours. Hence the principle for rental companies: first come, first served.

      I did this job and it was very profitable. I still have all the experiences and contracts I acquired during this period. I must mention that the job was very nerve-wracking and manual. I was constantly solving problems; the labor was not quality, on the phone day and night. At that point, I decided there must be a way to automate myself. So, I devised a system that would manage most of the functions I had to manage, to scale this business and let the team focus on what really matters â€“ finding clients and onboarding workers.

      My thesis is that there are always sectors in the market doing well, and sectors doing poorly. In any economic situation, those who can channel labor flow into successful sectors thrive.

      Thus, the principle of SkillHub is to automate the labor rental company, managing the entire process from the outset:

            <li class="mb-2">Automatic ads, targeted social media marketing, and SEO, which facilitate 24/7 online sales and direct all traffic to www.skillhub.ee.</li>
            <li class="mb-2">The platform registers companies and workers (along with skill levels) in our database, and SkillHub is installed on their computers and mobiles, allowing notifications to be sent directly to phones through the app.</li>
            <li class="mb-2">Companies can do two things:
                <ol type="a" style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;" class="mx-2 md:mx-6 mt-2">
                    <li class="mb-2">Search for the necessary specialist from the database, showing only those immediately available and also validated by the platform for skill levels, to ensure trust. However, a premium price is to be paid for this "on-demand" specialist.</li>
                    <li class="mb-2">If production volumes fall, the company can rent out its workers through the platform. The worker remains on their payroll but works for another company within a project framework. The company gives its own assessment of the worker (later the client does too), improving database quality through this mechanism. This allows companies to retain their workers in bad situations instead of laying them off, while still making money.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li class="mb-2">Specialists can map their skills through a modified ESCO activity classifier and upload themselves to our database, making them available to all companies. To enhance their credibility, job seekers must undergo a review of their skills in their field of activity at our partner companies, who then give an impartial assessment of their actual skills on a 1-5 ball scale (never heard, beginner, intermediate, proficient, specialist). The price for confirmed specialists is higher.</li>
            <li class="mb-2">Artificial intelligence constantly checks companies' "orders" with the properties of specialists in our database, and also collects data from the internet from public datasets about workers and companies. Based on all this information, AI offers "matching" to the parties.</li>
            <li class="mb-2">Once a "match" is achieved, it is offered to both parties, who can then only view information about the other party. If the project, company, and specialist match, a two-day "trial contract" is made through the platform, during which both parties can ensure compatibility.</li>
            <li class="mb-2">If everyone agrees, a full contract is concluded for the agreed period, for example, a two-month contract within the project.</li>
            <li class="mb-2">The contract is concluded directly on the platform and remains on the platform, always accessible to both parties, along with all conditions and fees, ensuring reliability.</li>
            <li class="mb-2">Now the specialist has time to fulfill the contract terms. For the process to run smoothly, the employer can monitor the worker's working hours, location, work progress and everything necessary directly from the platform without leaving home.</li>
            <li class="mb-2">At the end of the month, SkillHub issues an invoice to the subscriber and pays it either directly to the worker or to the company whose worker it is, and with that, the cycle is complete.</li>
